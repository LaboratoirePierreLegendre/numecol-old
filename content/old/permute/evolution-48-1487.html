The noFPU version has no such problems. Causes of this behaviorare unknown to me at the moment.The distribution file exists in two formats: one called "binhexed" (a textfile, permute-32.hqx) and one in Macbinary format (permute-32.bin). If you knowhow to de-binhex a file, then that's the one you should get because it willget to you intact for sure. If you can't de-binhex, you can grab theMacbinary file (set your FTP client to binary) but I can't guarantee it will work. That depends on your system and Internet connexion.If you have troubles with the files, please e-mail me<A HREF="http://www.bio.umontreal.ca/Casgrain/en/">Philippe Casgrain</A><BR>10-Aug-1995
