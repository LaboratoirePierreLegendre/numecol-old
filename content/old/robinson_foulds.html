			<h2>Robinson and Foulds topological distance</h2><small> <A HREF="http://www.info2.uqam.ca/~makarenv/">Vladimir Makarenkov</A><br>D&eacute;partement de Sciences Biologiques <br> Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al <br> C.P. 6128, succursale Centre-ville <br> Montr&eacute;al, Qu&eacute;bec H3C 3J7, Canada <br> </small>This program allows to compute in the optimal time the Robinson andFoulds topological distance between two or more additive trees given theirdistance matrices. The program is based on the algorithm proposed by <ahref="#ref">Makarenkov and Leclerc (1999, b)</a> for calculation of thisdistance. The algorithm implemented in this program uses the notion ofcircular orders to compare the topology of two trees. The algorithmdescribed in <a href="#ref">Makarenkov and Leclerc (1999, b)</a> hasoptimal time complexity, requiring O(n<sup>2</sup>) time when performed on two nxn distance matrices.The Robinson and Foulds topological distance is an important andfrequently used tool to compare additive (phylogenetic) tree structures(see for instance <a href="#ref">Robinson and Foulds (1981)</a> or <ahref="#ref">Makarenkov and Leclerc (1999, a,b)</a>). This distance is equalto the minimum number of elementary operations, consisting of merging orsplitting nodes, necessary to transform one tree into the other. As provedin <a href="#ref">Robinson and Foulds (1981)</a>, it is also the number ofbipartitions, or <a href="#ref">Buneman's splits (1971)</a>, which belongto exactly one of the two trees. If we deal with two unrooted trees havingno internal vertices labeled according to the elements of the set X, theRobinson and Foulds distance of on the set X of n elements varies between 0(when the trees are isomorphic) and 2n-6 (when all non-trivial bipartitionsin two trees are different; a trivial bipartition corresponds to an edgeincident to a leaf).The performed algorithm is also part of the computer package <a href="../../en/labo/t-rex/index.html">T-REX (Tree Reconstruction)</a> including some popular methods of tree reconstruction such as ADDTREE by <a href="#ref">Sattath and Tversky (1977)</a>, the Neighbor Joining method by <a href="#ref">Saitou and Nei (1987)</a>, the Unweighted Neighbor Joining method by <a href="#ref">Gascuel (1997)</a>, the Method of Weights by <a href="#ref">Makarenkov and Leclerc (1999, a)</a>, and others.<ul><li><b><a href="../../en/telecharger/index.html#RobinsonandFouldstopologicaldistance">32-bit DOS version</a> </b>(The executable file is a Win32 "console" executable, not a DOS executable.Therefore it cannot run under plain DOS, nor in a DOS window under Windows3.x, only in Windows 95/98 or Windows NT consoles) <p><ul><li>C source code for Win32, which can be compiled using a C/C++ compiler<li>Compiled version of the program for Win32 compatible computers<li>Program documentation, in Word 97 format<li>Sample files</ul><li><b><a href="../../en/telecharger/index.html#RobinsonandFouldstopologicaldistance">Unix version</a> </b> <ul> <li>C source code for U<small>NIX</small>, which can be compiled using a C/C++ compiler<li>Program documentation (user's guide), in A<small>SCII</small> format<li>Sample files<li><em>No executable program is distributed, it is assumed that you will compile your own for your flavor of U<small>NIX</small>.</em></ul><li><b><a href="../../en/telecharger/index.html#RobinsonandFouldstopologicaldistance">Macintosh version</a> </b><ul> <li>C source code for Macintosh, which can be compiled using a C/C++ compiler<li>Compiled versions of the program for Macintosh computers with a PowerPC processor<li>Program documentation, in Word 6 format<li>Sample files</ul></ul><a name="ref">References:</a><br><blockquote>Buneman, P. 1971.
