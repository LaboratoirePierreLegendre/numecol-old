The problem which motivated the development of the method is thefollowing: How does one relate the biological and behavioral characteristics ofanimals (matrix <B>B</B>) to habitat characteristics of the locations at which they arefound (matrix <B>C</B>), given the distribution of animals across sampling sites(matrix <B>A</B>)? Statistical parameters in matrix <B>D</B> are estimated by the followingmatrix operation: <B>D</B> = <B>C</B> <B>A</B>' <B>B</B>. They are tested for significance using a permutation procedure. Random permutations of matrix <B>A</B> can be obtained under four different permutational models.Documents available for distribution include: <UL>	<LI><b><a href="../../en/telecharger/index.html#The4thCorner">Macintosh version</a> </b>	<UL>		<LI><a href="../../en/fortran.html">Fortran</a> source code		<LI>Compiled versions of the program for Macintosh computers using 680x0, 680x0 + FPU, or PowerPC processor		<LI>Program documentation, in Word 5 (Macintosh)		<LI>A folder containing three ASCII files, called A1, B1 and C1, corresponding to Example 1 of the documentation	</UL>	<P>	For the researcher with a huge dataset, we have <a href="../../en/telecharger/index.html#The4thCorner">compiled a version</a>  (PowerMacintosh only) that can accomodate 550 species, 800 stations and 50 behavioral / habitat characteristics.
