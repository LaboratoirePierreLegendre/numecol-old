Several spatial analysisprograms use these files as their source of information about theneighboring relationships that exist among localities; this is the caseof program <A HREF="autocorrelation.html">AUTOCOR</A> for spatial autocorrelation analysis, the spatiallyconstrained clustering programs <A HREF="biogeo.html">BIOGEO</A> and <A HREF="kmeans.html">K-MEANS</A>, as well as the<A HREF="cocopan.html">COCOPAN</A> analysis of variance program.	When the points form a regular grid on the map, it is easy to linkthe first neighbors using simple connecting schemes whose names arederived from the game of chess <A HREF="../references.html#9">(Cliff &amp; Ord, 1981)</A>: rook's(square), bishop's (diagonal), or king's connections (also calledqueen's: both square and diagonal).	When the localities are positioned in an irregular manner, geometricconnecting schemes may be used, such as the Gabriel's connection<A HREF="../references.html#10">(Gabriel &amp; Sokal, 1969)</A>, the Delaunay triangulation <A HREF="../references.html#11">(Dirichlet,1850</A>; <A HREF="../references.html#23">Upton &amp; Fingleton, 1985)</A>, or the relative neighborhood graph.There exists an inclusion relationship among those connecting schemes:all connexions that obey the relative neighborhood graph definition are alsomembers of the Gabriel graph, which in turn are all included in theDelaunay triangulation.<HR><p align="center">	<A HREF="http://www.bio.umontreal.ca/Casgrain/en/labo/R/v3/description/index.html">Up</A> |	<a href="cocopan.html">Previous</a> | <A HREF="index.html">Table of Contents</A> | <a href="conversion.html">Next</a>	| <A HREF="http://www.bio.umontreal.ca/Casgrain/fr/labo/R/v3/description/connexions.html">Version Fran&ccedil;aise</A></p><h6 align=center>	Last updated on Saturday, March 30, 2013 by <A HREF="http://www.bio.umontreal.ca/Casgrain/en/">Philippe Casgrain</A></h6></body></html>
